Richer Comments and Linkbacks for WordPress!

== Description ==

Generates richer WordPress comments from linkbacks such as [Webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention) or classic linkback protocols like Trackback or Pingback.

The limited display for trackbacks and linkbacks is replaced by a clean full sentence, such as "Bob mentioned this article on bob.com." If Bob's site uses markup that the plugin can interpret, it may add his profile picture or other parts of his page to display as a full comment.

Semantic Linkbacks uses [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) to get information about the linked post and it is highly extensible to also add support for other forms of markup.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to mark up my site? =

Most modern WordPress themes support the older Microformats standard, which means the plugin should be able to get basic information from
to enhance linkbacks. The plugin is most useful with webmention support(separate plugin) and sites/themes that support Microformats 2.

= Why Webmentions? =

[Webmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) is a modern reimplementation of Pingback and is now a W3C Recommendation.

= What about the semantic "comment" types? =

The IndieWeb community defines several types of feedback supported by this plugin:

* Replies: <http://indieweb.org/replies>
* Reposts: <http://indieweb.org/repost>
* Likes: <http://indieweb.org/likes>
* Favorites: <http://indieweb.org/favorite>
* RSVPs: <http://indieweb.org/rsvp>
* Tagging: <http://indieweb.org/tag>
* Bookmarks: <http://indieweb.org/bookmark>
* Quote: <http://indieweb.org/quotation>
* Classic "Mentions": <http://indieweb.org/mentions>

= How do I extend this plugin? =

See [Extensions](https://indieweb.org/Semantic_Linkbacks#Extensions)

= Who made the logos? =

The Webmention and Pingback logos are made by [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com) and the Microformats logo is made by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/work/microformats/)
